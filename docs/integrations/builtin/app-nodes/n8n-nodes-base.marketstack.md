## Example usage

This workflow allows you to get the past week's end of day data for a desired stock symbol. This example usage workflow uses the following two nodes.

- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [marketstack]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
