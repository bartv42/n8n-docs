## FAQs

### How to load all the parameters for the node?

To load all the parameters, for example, Author ID, you need to give admin permissions to the user. Refer to the [WeKan documentation](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Features#members-click-member-initials-or-avatar--permissions-adminnormalcomment-only) to learn how to change permissions.
