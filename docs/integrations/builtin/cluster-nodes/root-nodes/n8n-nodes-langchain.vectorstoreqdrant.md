# Qdrant Vector Store

Use the Qdrant node to interact with your Qdrant collection as a vector store. You can insert documents into a vector database, get documents from a vector database, and retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a chain.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Qdrant node, and links to more resources.
