# CrowdStrike credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate when using the HTTP Request node to make a [Custom API call](/integrations/custom-operations/).

## Authentication methods 

n8n supports CrowdStrike authentication using OAuth2.

## Related resources

Refer to CrowdStrike's documentation for more information about the service. Their documentation is behind a log in, so you must log in to your account on their website to access the API documentation.
