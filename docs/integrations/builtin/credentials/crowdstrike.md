You can use these credentials to authenticate when using the HTTP Request node to make a [Custom API call](/integrations/custom-operations/).

## Authentication methods 

n8n supports CrowdStrike authentication using OAuth2.

Refer to CrowdStrike's documentation for more information about the service. Their documentation is behind a log in, so you must log in to your account on their website to access the API documentation.

This is a credential-only node. Refer to [Custom API operations](/integrations/custom-operations/) to learn more. View [example workflows and related content](https://n8n.io/integrations/crowdstrike/){:target=_blank .external-link} on n8n's website.
